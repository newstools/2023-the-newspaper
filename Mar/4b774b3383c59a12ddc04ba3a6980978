Chocolat Bistro in Durbanville’s owner, Wilma Basson, has spared no effort in creating a new luxurious private function space on the same property as the Bistro. Her innate style and love for the French aesthetic is evident in every small detail. From the unique Bird Cages converted into lights to the exquisite wall art, The Bird Cage at Chocolat Bistro oozes a sophistication that cannot go unnoticed. The idea for the Bird Cage originated from the demand for sophisticated yet reasonably priced function space in central Durbanville where friends, family, and colleagues can celebrate in their own private space.  With covid restrictions being a distant memory, patrons are increasingly seeking spaces to celebrate life with family and friends, whether that be birthday’s, bridal showers, baby showers, weddings or corporate functions.  Bird Cage at Chocolat is a totally private venue apart from the main restaurant and boasts its own fully equipped bar with fireplace, kitchen, restrooms, and function area. They offer various function and set menu options and can customize your event to meet your desire in every way.  Patrons will host their guests in complete elegance with Jenna Clifford crockery, crystal glasses, fine table linen, fresh flowers, and sumptuous meal choices. The premium quality wireless sound system also allows guests hassle-free streaming of their own music choices should they prefer, and back-up power is also available during load shedding  The Bird Cage can host up to 60 guests for breakfast, lunch, dinner and high teas, which makes it a unique space in the centre of Durbanville. Enjoy every corner of this illustrious space at your leisure and revel in the wondrous experience they have to offer.
