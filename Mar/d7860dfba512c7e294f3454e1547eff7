Celebrating its 13th anniversary at the iconic Houw Hoek Hotel the weekend of 17 – 19 March 2023, SA’s premier three-day stage trail run, the AFRICANX TRAILRUN will once again close off on a high note with entrants vying for the coveted title of “Best Dressed Team” on Sunday during the third and final stage of the event. “Dress Up Day is one of the many highlights of the AFRICANX TRAILRUN,” says Michael Meyer, Managing Director of Stillwater Sports and Event Founder. “The competition is fierce, with trail runners pulling out all the stops to secure the coveted ‘Best Dressed Team’ title. The trail running community has a wicked sense of humour. In 2022 we had runners dressed as super-heroes, peacocks, beer ladies, doctors and nurses, firefighters, lifesavers, minions, even a boxer and his coach to mention just a few examples.” “The Dress Up competition definitely brings additional excitement to the final stage of the AFRICANX TRAILRUN when runners are feeling tired after two consecutive days of running,” continues Meyer. “With Stage Three being the shortest of the three stages, Dress Up Day gives runners the boost needed to complete the stage on a high note. Runners are guaranteed to start the stage laughing. To be in the running to be crowned the best dressed team and win an entry into the 2024 AFRICANX TRAILRUN, we are looking for commitment and flair.” “Both runners need to wear their outfits for the duration of the stage, from start to finish. Don’t leave it too late, get those creative juices flowing and close off the 2023 AFRICANX TRAILRUN in style by being the Best Dressed team.” For more information visit www.stillwatersports.com
