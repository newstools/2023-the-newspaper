Following the success of the first Cape 1000 classic car tribute in 2022, the second iteration, takes place from 19 – 24 March 2023. Competitors will take on the scenic roads of the Western Cape from the Mother City to Hermanus and then to George and Franschhoek, before heading back to the V & A Waterfront. Inspired by legendary tribute races all over the world, the Cape 1000 sees participants compete on some of the best roads in the world over four days and five nights. As the event’s name suggests, it is run over 1000 miles (1 600 km) with 60% of the route consisting of “grand touring” and the remaining 40% comprising challenging regularity stages, during which navigators and drivers have to work closely together and meticulously follow the stage’s timing and speed instructions to achieve success and, hopefully, score some points. So, it’s not a race, but certainly still a challenge, one which is won through consistency, reliability and accuracy. This year’s instalment of the Cape 1000 will include a restomod/recreation class. Cars will compete in five different classes: 1927-1957 (Tribute), Pre-1976 (Classic), 1977-1996 (Modern classic), 1997-current (Sports), and Restomod/recreation. Some special cars have been entered, with the oldest dating back to 1933. Beneficiaries of the Cape 1000 include the Motorsport Legends Benevolent Fund and QuadPara Association of South Africa. The Cape 1000 promises to not only be a memorable experience for the participants, but also for those watching and cheering from the side lines.
