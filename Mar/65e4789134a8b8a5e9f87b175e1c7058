If you are an avid sightseer, this might be just the thing for you. Cape Sidecar Adventures makes exploring the Cape an especially fun and adventurous activity. Cape Sidecar Adventures boasts a fleet of sidecars, available for team building, corporate events, weddings, anniversaries, tour visits and even unique childrenâ€™s parties. The vintage World War II motorbike sidecars provide chauffeured tours and transfers around the city of Cape Town, the Cape Peninsula and the Cape Winelands. A great, safe way to explore the Cape without the worries of crowds and confined spaces. Brody the Dog A member of the crew is Brody, the dog. He is well trained, wears his buff and goggles and sits perfectly upright in his own sidecar. Brody is a graduate of the DARG (Domestic Animal Rescue Group) rescue shelter based in Hout Bay. He has become more famous than the sidecars. He mostly travels with his dad, Tim, and can be booked for a ride in exchange for a handful of biltong.
