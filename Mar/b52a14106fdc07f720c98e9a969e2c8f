The Cape Town Cycle Tour Lifecycle Expo is South Africa’s leading cycling, health and fitness exhibition. It serves as the only registration venue for the Cape Town Cycle Tour, with thousands of excited cyclists passing through the Expo. Their family and friends and Expo visitors also come along, adding another 15 000 to 20 000 visitors to the event. Many products are available for a highly focussed audience of individuals, who have been thinking of this event since they entered in late September. They have been training, keeping fit, eating well and are knowledgeable of the sport and fitness in general. The Cape Town Cycle Tour contributes significantly to the tourism industry of the Western Cape, bringing many families from outside of Cape Town to visit our beautiful city. Over the years many new products have been launched at the Expo, some cycling or health specific and many others from every day industries such as communications, general health products to financial products. “As an organising team, we offer a professional service made up of industry leaders in a world-class venue. Many of our clients have been with us from inception in 1990. We look forward to welcoming you to the Cape Town Cycle Tour Expo.” The Expo will run from Thursday, 9 March – Saturday, 11 March 2023, with the Cycle Tour taking place on Sunday, 12 March.
