Bloubergstrand’s own gorgeous Zandria-Simone Post can now add Mrs South Africa Semi-finalist to her impressive resume as she joins the class of 2023. Following the announcement, the semi-finalists took part in a jam-packed two-day conference filled with motivational talks, workshops, upskilling sessions, socialising and networking opportunities, and an introduction to the famous Mrs SA sisterhood. “I expected this result as God has placed me in this amazing opportunity, and I am working towards the crown, in the end, so Semi-finals is the first step getting there,” Zandria-Simone said Mrs South Africa is a self-discovery and empowerment programme that celebrates diversity, ambition, and confidence while showcasing some of the country’s most phenomenal and talented women and giving them the skills and tools needed to achieve their dreams. Sharing more about her decision to enter, Post says, “After years of procrastinating this destiny that was put aside for my life, I finally had no more excuses. I decided that this is my calling and I will follow it. After 13 years of not being a mother, I feel I share the heartache of infertile woman and I want to do my part in creating hope for these women out there. If I can contribute to helping just one woman to carry the title of a mother, my journey will be completed and successful.” As part of her journey, she hopes to take the title of Mrs South Africa and part of this journey she wants to create awareness on anxiety and fear and most of all awareness and support systems for people suffering from infertility. She wants to support and advocate for Fertility clinics and support further studies in this field. Zandria-Simone Post fully embodies the values that Mrs SA holds most dear, and is representative of their tagline for the year: #EveryWoman.
