The Brookdale Estate outside Paarl has announced the opening of The Bistro at Brookdale on 1 February 2023. The Bistro at Brookdale promises a relaxed, contemporary Paarl Winelands dining experience. Seasoned executive chef Gary Coetzee is at the helm of the restaurant, assisted by restaurant and tasting room manager Michelle Michaels. Diners may expect soulful dishes, brought together with wines grown on the surrounding vines and vinified by winemaker, Kiara Scott. Adjacent to the newly constructed Bistro and the cellar, the Tasting Room will be open inviting guests to immerse themselves into the Brookdale experience and sampling the estateâ€™s terroir-driven vintages, made in ever-evolving styles. The Bistro and Tasting Room is built and decorated in a contemporary style, and includes both indoor, and outside dining spaces on the wide terrace overlooking the surrounding vineyards. The menu features fresh and wholesome cuisine, including some of the signature dishes sampled and favoured by guests who have stayed at the Brookdale Manor House, since its opening in 2021. The Bistro experience is further complemented by an exciting wine list that showcases the Brookdale and Mason Road ranges, in addition to other interesting wines from the Paarl region and beyond. The Bistro at Brookdale will be open for lunch from Tuesdays to Sundays, with dinner served on Friday and Saturday evenings.
