There is a ballet buzz in the air as the buoyant summer season atmosphere lingers across the Mother City and shows no sign of abating! The acclaimed South African International Ballet Competition (SAIBC), celebrating its milestone 10th anniversary this year, is capitalising on the upward trend that ballet continues to enjoy. The competition takes place at Artscape from 23-26 July 2023. In 2023, Capetonians can look forward to a smorgasbord of wonderful dance productions. From traditional ballet classics like Cinderella to outdoor performances at Maynardville, moving tribute productions like Dreaming Dance in District Six – The Johaar Mosaval Story and the annual SAIBC, ballet and dance lovers have their pick of exciting options. The 10th SAIBC is taking place once again at the Artscape Opera House in Cape Town from 23 – 26 July 2023 and will be presented as a hybrid event.
