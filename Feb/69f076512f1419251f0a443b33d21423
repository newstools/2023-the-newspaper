For the 10th edition of Investec Cape Town Art Fair, we are thrilled to announce the 88 participating exhibitors. Produced by Fiera Milano Exhibitions Africa, a leader and one of the main integrated operators worldwide in the exhibition and congress sector, the Fair takes place from 17-19 February 2023 at Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) and will focus on the concept of time. Sections will explore the theme to mark a decade of the art fair, and events will highlight the art fair’s journey and impact over the last decade. The 2023 edition provides a moment to reflect on the fair’s impact, in bringing the visual arts community under one roof and creating a platform for the advancement of the sector.
By bringing together a diverse group of celebrated exhibitors, including prominent galleries from around the globe, Investec Cape Town Art Fair has also provided an opportunity to showcase Cape Town, the city’s people and their creative achievements.
