Rebecca Seziba, the little girl who went viral while playing a public piano in Table Bay Mall in December 2022, has signed an international record deal. Rudi Smith spotted the young lady at the Table Bay Mall playing the piano and shared the video on his Facebook page. The clip has gained over a million views and caught the attention of Rahul Suntah, – a composer, producer and pianist from Mauritius, currently based in England. The record company reached out to the family with a proposal for a collaborative deal between Suntah and Rebecca.  The deal was agreed upon, and a contract was signed. Rebecca has an ear and a natural talent for music, as she is completely self-taught and has never had piano lessons. Most of her inspiration came from watching her brother play the piano fluently. Rebecca said that she loved playing the piano and wants to study music and become a professional pianist one day. “My parents encourage me to be self-motivated and believe in myself. I believe nothing is impossible.”
