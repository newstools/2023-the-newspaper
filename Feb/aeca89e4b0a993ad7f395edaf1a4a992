The City of Cape Town hosted an event at Maiden’s Cove to welcome teams and officials to the Mother City ahead of the ICC T20 Women’s World Cup. Cape Town is one of three venues for the tournament, which gets under way on Friday, 10 February 2023. The captains of all participating teams were gifted a ‘piece of South Africa’ as a memento and a reminder of their experience in Cape Town. The players also had the opportunity to mingle with each other and take in the scenic beauty at Maiden’s Cove before they battle it out this coming week. In the week ahead, the teams will go their separate ways, ahead of the tournament, which is set to start on Friday, 10 February until 26 February.  Some of the teams will head to the other host cities, Gqeberha and Paarl. The host nation, South Africa, and Sri Lanka will kick off what will be an exciting 15 days of world class cricket action at Newlands Cricket Ground this Friday. ‘It is a pleasure to welcome all participating nations to Cape Town and we are thrilled to be hosting them in our beautiful city. Hosting Africa’s first ever international women’s cricket event in our city is testament to Cape Town’s ability to successfully stage major international events. Our support for the T20 Women’s World Cup forms part of the City of Cape Town’s contribution to efforts aimed at elevating the status of women’s sports and providing as many platforms for athletes to showcase their skills. We wish all the players, officials, the fans, Cricket South Africa and the ICC a successful tournament,’ said the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security Alderman JP Smith. Newlands Cricket Ground will host 12 matches including two semi-finals and the final.
