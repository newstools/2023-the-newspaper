Faahkir Bestman (19) was always destined for greatness. From the moment he first stepped onto a dance floor, it was clear to all who saw him that he had something special.
Dubbed Hanover Park’s Billy Elliot, the young Capetonian caught the eye of Abeedah Medell of the famed Eoan Group when he was just eight years old. Believing in his talents, Abeedah gave Faahkir the formative training he needed and encouraged him to dream beyond his reality. With each step, Faahkir grew stronger and more determined to dance on the big stages of the world. At just twelve years old, he won the inaugural Christopher Kindo scholarship, allowing him to attend the National School of the Arts in Johannesburg. In Grade 9, Intocast SA selected him for their bursary programme which covered all his expenses through high school. Before his final matric exams, Faahkir was awarded the opportunity of a lifetime: a scholarship to attend the prestigious Joffrey Ballet School in New York. The Johannesburg Youth Ballet (JYB) has taken up the cause and is driving and managing a fundraising campaign on BackaBuddy, to ensure that Faahkir has everything he needs for his time at the Joffrey Ballet. “There are many talented young dancers who want to make a career out of dance, but it is perhaps once or twice in a lifetime that someone with Faahkir’s talent, commitment, passion, and focus to achieve despite adversity crosses your path. I have seen his growth as an artist in all genres of dance. He is eager to learn, takes and applies corrections, and is passionate about everything he does. He is a bright and humble young man, with incredible stage presence, that I know is destined for greatness,” says Mark Hawkins (Artistic Director of the Johannesburg Youth Ballet).
