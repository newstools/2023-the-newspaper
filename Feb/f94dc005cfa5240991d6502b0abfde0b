In South Africa, the new, seventh-generation Isuzu D-Max has made its official debut, delivering more technology and safety than ever before. The D-Max is poised to upend the status quo in the leisure double cab market because of its outstanding good looks and comfortable ride. This Isuzu bakkie is not just the brand’s most sought-after model ever; it is also proudly made in South Africa! In the previous 42 years, the manufacturer’s Struandale facility in Gqeberha has produced seven generations of Isuzu bakkies. Although the broad, incredibly competent D-Max model line for Mzanzi is exported to 25 left and right-hand drive countries around the African continent, it is something distinctive. Five Single Cabs, six Extended Cabs, and an astounding eleven Double Cab versions are available, ranging from the most basic 3.0 Ddi V-Cross 4×4 to the most spacious 1.9 Ddi HR L. The Reeds new vehicle sales team, which is a member of one of the top-performing Isuzu  dealers in the nation, is prepared to meet with you to talk about your vehicle needs and to assist you in getting into a car for your needs or those of your family or company.
