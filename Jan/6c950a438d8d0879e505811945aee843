SA20 is South Africa’s explosive new T20 cricket league. Dropping 10 January 2023, the League is set to thrill local and international cricket fans and attract new audiences of all ages. South Africa’s iconic stadiums will be the place to be from 10 January – 11 February; where cricket fanatics, party people and families can gather to watch the world’s best T20 cricketers in action – 4 weeks, 33 matches, 6 global franchises, 102 world class players (local and global). SA20 has the backing of some of the most recognised T20 franchises in the world, with several IPL strongholds branching out to establish an even greater international footprint. The franchises are owned by six dynamic entities which have made a minimum 10-year investment which will sustain South African cricket, the players and future cricketers coming through the development pipeline. The League features six privately-owned teams, who will play each other twice in a round-robin stage (home and away) before the semis and final. In all, 33 matches will be played in some of the greatest locations South Africa has to offer: Durban’s Super Giants (Kingsmead), Joburg Super Kings (Wanderers), MI Cape Town (Newlands), Paarl Royals (Boland Park), Pretoria Capitals (Centurion) and Sunrisers Eastern Cape (St George’s Park).
The six teams finalised their 17-member squads during the R125 million player auction. Each team is allowed to field up to four international players in a match, giving plenty of opportunities for homegrown Proteas stars and young local talent to shine while playing alongside the best in the world. SA20 is destined to become the world’s second-largest league, but with “South Africa’s No 1 Sport and Entertainment brand” firmly locked in as the target, you can expect thrilling cricket underpinned by an immersive, inclusive, and unmissable social experience.
