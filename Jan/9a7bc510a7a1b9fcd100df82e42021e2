Capetonians are invited to join the fun-filled AFRICANX Training Run 3 on Sunday, 5 February 2023, at Constantia Nek at 06:30. “The AFRICANX TRAILRUN is South Africa’s premier 3-Day Stage Race that takes place each year in the Western Cape in March,” says Michael Meyer, Managing Director of Stillwater Sports and Founder of the AFRICANX TRAILRUN. “To help trail runners get race ready we are excited to host numerous training runs in Gauteng and the Western Cape. The training runs are also the perfect opportunity for runners to get to know each other and our team.” “The AFRICANX Training Run 3 at Constantia Nek will consist of a 17.5km route that will feature the same type of flowing single track and climbs as that of Day 2 of the AFRICANX TRAILRUN,” confirms Meyer. “Runners should plan on running between 2½ to 3 hours and can expect some fantastic single-track sections with technical climbs in between.” “AFRICANX ambassador Ashraf Orrie aka Mr O, will lead the group on Sunday,” continues Meyer. “Although the route won’t be marked, there will be pacers and pack runners with various pace groups. Look forward to an awesome morning of trail running with the AFRICANX family. Be sure to take lots of photographs.” “This year sees me coming of age at my 10th running of the AFRICANX TRAILRUN in March,” says Orrie. “I wouldn’t miss it for anything. The event really is a coming together of the AFRICANX family from far and wide. It’s a weekend that’s filled with fun and laughter, good food and entertainment. It’s exactly what you need after a hard day of running on the beautiful trails in Elgin, Grabouw, Houw Hoek and surrounds. I am excited to be leading the AFRICANX Training Run 3 this coming Sunday. Trail runners will get a good idea of what to expect come race weekend. Also be sure to ask lots of questions, that is why we are there.” For more information visit www.stillwatersports.com
