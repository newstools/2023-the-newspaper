Cape Town’s beloved Maynardville Open-Air Theatre season is back and better than ever, sporting a new food market and a full season of music, opera, ballet and Shakespeare under the stars. The Maynardville Open-Air Theatre Festival season is a highlight for Cape Town summers. In recent years, it has expanded to feature a full schedule of classic plays in addition to a traditional Shakespeare play. Shakespeare and classical concerts are combined in this expanded seasonal format by VR Theatrical. Shakespeare’s fantasy comedy, “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” will be the featured production in 2023. Geoffrey Hyland is directing it, and after his successes with “Richard the Third” (2019) and “Twelfth Night” (2017), it promises to be a fresh take on this magical classic. The lead roles will be played by actors Chi Mhende and Mark Elderkin. The Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra will present the musical, “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” by Mendelssohn as the orchestral programme, and the Cape Town City Ballet will present a programme of two works titled “SummerSnow”, which will contrast the hot summer heat with works with strong, icy winter themes. An unforgettable choral performance of “Songs of Shakespeare” as a tribute to the great playwright is also on the schedule for the Maynardville Festival. The season dates are: 19 – 21 January: The Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra | 26 – 29 January: Cape Town Opera | 2 to 23 February: A Midsummer Night’s Dream | 1 – 5 March: Cape Town City Ballet. The tradition of having a picnic in the park remains a custom of the Maynardville Theatre, but picnics can now be ordered in advance and collected on arrival. The Maynardville Evening Food Market, which will be open to the public in the summer evenings and run throughout the festival, offers a variety of food and beverages for patrons to choose from.
