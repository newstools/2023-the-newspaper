Settle into the balmy evenings of the season by joining celebrated wineries at the Stellenbosch Street Soirees. A favourite for friends to catch up over fine food and wine beneath famous oaks and wine-lovers seeking to experience the heartland of South African wine in all its glory, the Street Soirees are the place to be. Unsurprisingly, the Stellenbosch Street Soirees have become an annual highlight of the region. It offers enthusiasts the opportunity to taste wine and socialise in an elegant setting amongst towering oaks at the Cape’s finest time of the year. As is the tradition, sumptuous street food from local purveyors including renowned chef Bertus Basson’s De Vrije Burger, will be on offer, along with smooth and contemporary music. The dates for the Street Soirees are 18 January, 1 and 15 February, and 1 and 15 March. Between 15 and 25 wineries will participate per event. The Street Soirees were conceptualised to provide visitors with a taste of Stellenbosch life, but also as an opportunity for locals to enjoy their town. Not only celebrated for its wines, Stellenbosch has established a firm reputation for the quality of its hospitality, restaurants and accommodation; classic style and urban appeal.
