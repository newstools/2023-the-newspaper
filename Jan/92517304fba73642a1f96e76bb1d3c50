“Come and enjoy a collaboration between Experi-Buddies and the V&A Waterfront for a workshop where we will inspire your little Scientists to explore the world of science.” Experi-Buddies is an educational programme that uses experiments to show young children that the world of science can be fun. We introduce Scientific concepts in an age-appropriate way by means of interactive projects, exciting demonstrations, and basic experiments. We will be covering various Scientific fields: Chemistry, Meteorology, Geology, Astronomy, Physics and Biology. Our aim: “To give each child an opportunity to do at least one experiment on their own with a wow factor; give a basic explanation of the Science behind each experiment and have as much fun as possible, and to introduce our little Einstein’s to an unforgettable learning experience!” Each child will have the unique experience of wearing their own lab coat and feel like a real Scientist!” Dates: 14, 21 and 29 January | Location: Watershed, V & A Waterfront
