Experience an incredibly scenic encounter, meandering through the Knysna Elephant Park at elephant pace with panoramic views of the Outeniqua mountains and Knysna forest. Join the guides who will relate informative ‘elephant tales,’ while you follow in the footsteps of these remarkable animals. The Knysna Elephant Park (est. 1994) was the first facility in South Africa to house and care for orphaned African elephants. Over the last twenty years, the park has cared for and raised more than forty elephants. “Our style of management offers guests the opportunity to get up close and personal with our elephants, on elephant terms. Responsible and educational interactions allow guests to appreciate the awe-inspiring presence of these animals, but still give the elephants the space and freedom to choose where they want to move, what they want to eat, and who they want to interact with.”
