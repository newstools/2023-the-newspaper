At the end of 2023 the warmth and neighbourliness of Capetonians has been recognised by Conde Nast Traveller Readers, with the city being named as one of the world’s friendliest. Compiled by surveying Conde Nast’s 16 million strong audience, Cape Town took the 10th position overall and leading African city. The friendliest city in the world was named as San Miguel de Allende in Mexico. “The past year has seen encouraging growth in both international and local travel and hospitality in Cape Town. Being named one of the friendliest cities in the world, means yet again that the Mother City is being recognised as a truly world class, inclusive destination, and that fills us with pride. As a visitor walks through the streets of Cape Town, explores our national parks, enjoy our beaches, enjoys what our winelands create, they will undoubtedly enjoy the natural beauty of Cape Town,” says CEO at Cape Town Tourism, Enver Duminy. “But what turns that enjoyment into a love for our city is what we as locals offer. Our warmth, passion, welcoming nature, our friendliness is the magic ingredient that keeps visitors coming back to Cape Town year, after year, after year.”
