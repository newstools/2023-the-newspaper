Plantation Shutters is excited to introduce the integrated flyscreen shutter to their existing range of iconic products. With Plantation Security Shutters being renowned for their strength and beautiful aesthetic, the addition of integrated mesh flyscreens, now offers discerning customers an added dimension in shutter coverings. This all-in-one system operates seamlessly to allow you to keep your windows open all day and night, with complete peace of mind. Absolutely perfect for homes, guesthouses and game lodges. With a choice of mesh grades – the standard mesh, which is made from PVC-coated fibre glass and comes with a 1-year warranty, is ideal for keeping out insects, flies, lizards, snakes, small animals and creepy crawlies. The tuff mesh, which is custom-weaved PVC-coated polyester and comes with a 2-year warranty, is better suited if you have pets like cats that may find it irresistible to scratch, or if you’re looking to keep inquisitive animals, like monkeys, at bay. This integrated system can be installed across all hinged window and door solutions and consists of one frame, combining both mesh flyscreen panels and shutter panels in one easy installation, without compromising your view. Available in security and aluminium shutter design options. Carrying the same minimum and maximum specs as per the standard hinged shutters with regard to design and installation, the frame design makes for an easy installation and sliding of the mesh panels, once installed.
