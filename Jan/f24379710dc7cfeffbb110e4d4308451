On 13 January 2023 the MI Cape Town will take on Durban Super Giants and Saturday, 14 January they will take on the Joburg Super Kings in Newlands. At the pre-match press conference in Cape Town, MI Cape Town’s pacer, Olly Stone said his team is aiming to win all three games at home and make it a fortress. “You go out there to win every game. Obviously, having the first three games here at Newlands is massive. Hopefully, we can make this a fortress and learn from the other night and get two more wins on the board. And if another bonus point comes our way, we’ll look to take it,” Stone said. In preparation for the upcoming games, the team met with the coaching staff and prepared key strategies, “Yes, we have two tough games coming up in as many days. We (the team) sat down and watched the games (of opposition players) in the team room. We discussed how we might go about (in our strategy against) different players. We’ve seen how dangerous certain players in those teams can be. So, in the build-up tomorrow and the day after, we are going to create a few plans that might work. Obviously, you can’t be dependent on one plan, so we have a few strategies about how to go about different players and different situations,” Stone said. The right-arm-quick also claimed that his team will keep the pitches in mind and stated that back-to-back victories at the weekend will put hosts in a strong position early in the competition. “The fans were brilliant here the other night. The atmosphere and the buzz they created around the ground just make you go out there and perform (your best). So, it’s going to be a big couple of games for us and looking forward to seeing them cheer us out in big numbers again,” he signed off.
