A journey through the Cradle of Human Culture traces the origins and development of human culture over the past 160 000 years, and, in the process, it also uncovers what it means to be human. The Cradle of Human Culture is rooted in three main archaeological sites in the Western Cape. These sites preserve some of the world’s earliest evidence of the evolution of modern human behaviour. From engraved ostrich eggshells and bone tools to shell beads and the first evidence of drawing, visitors will discover some of humanity’s earliest use of symbols, art and technological innovation. By following our early predecessors’ footsteps, visitors will discover how we became what we are today. The Cradle of Human Culture includes several archaeological and palaeontological sites in the Western Cape. The three major ones are Diepkloof Rock Shelter on the Cape West Coast (Weskus), Blombos Cave and Pinnacle Point on the Southern Cape Coast. However, a trip to the Cradle of Human Culture includes more than these three sites, and the development and expression of human culture can be traced across all sites. Experience the two journeys through the Western Cape, forming part of the Cradle of Human Culture. Along the Artist’s Journey in the Cape West Coast (Weskus), you will discover the West Coast Fossil Park, San Rock art dotted along the Cederberg and unique guided experiences that will leave you feeling inspired. Along the Coastal Journey, you will catch a glimpse of the Cape Winelands, delving into the Cape Overberg and exploring the famous Garden Route & Klein Karoo discovering coastal caves and the underground cave wonder known as the Cango Caves.
